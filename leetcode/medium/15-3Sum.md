## Solution

```js
var threeSum = function (nums) {
  let result = [];
  let len = nums.length;
  nums.sort((a, z) => a - z); // 1

  for (let i = 0; i < len - 2; i++) {
    if (i > 0 && nums[i] === nums[i - 1]) continue; // 2

    let left = i + 1, // 3
      right = len - 1;

    while (left < right) {
      let sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]; // 4

      if (sum === 0) {
        result.push([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]]); // 5
        left++;
        right--;
        // 6
        while (nums[left] === nums[left - 1] && left < right) {
          left++;
        }

        while (nums[right] === nums[right + 1] && left < right) {
          right--;
        }
        // 7
      } else if (sum > 0) {
        right--;
      } else if (sum < 0) {
        left++;
      }
    }
  }

  return result;
};
```

### Explanation

At a high level this problem is solved by first sorting the input array, and second travering the array, keeping one fixed elemnt and finding the other two numbers we need via a left and right pointer.

1. Sort the input
2. Iterate over the newly sorted input (_note:_ we iterate while `i < nums.length - 2` this is because our pointers will check the last two numbers of the array). Then we can check that while `i` is not at its first index that our current element and our preivous element are not equal to each other.
3. Setup our two pointers starting left one index ahead of our fixed element and right at the end of the input.
4. On each iteration of our while loop we calculate the sum from the value of our fixed element, and the elements at our left and right pointers.
5. If our sum is equal to zero (our target) than we can push our values into our result.
6. Next we move our left and right pointers so that neither pointer is pointing to an element where that element is not equal to the previous element. So we can continue to avoid duplicates.
7. If our sum is not equal to zero then we move our left or right pointer accordingly and iterating again.
